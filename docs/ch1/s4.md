Using the final character in Brainfuck, `,`, we can accept user input. `,` stores the ASCII value corresponding to the user's input into the cell that is currently being pointed to. Note that this means when the user enters a number like `4`, the value being stored in the cell is not `4` but the ASCII value for `4` (which happens to be 52). This also means that Brainfuck can only accept user input one character at a time. If you would like to accept multiple characters of input at any one time, you will need to keep track of the storage and request multiple characters of input yourself.
